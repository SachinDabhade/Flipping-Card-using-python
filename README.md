# Flipping-Card-using-python
I have see a question on youtube and I am very curious to solve it and finally I solve it very clearly. The question is "20 random cards are placed in a row all faces down. A turn consists of taking two adjacent card where the left 1 is faced up and the right one can be faced up or faced down and flipping them both. Show that this process can be terminate.(With all the cards facing up)"  and the solution for this is as follow.
## Explanation
Here, We have 20 random cards. We have to flip all cards down. We consider the faces of card as '0' and '1'. '0' is face down and '1' is face up. A loop consists of 'i' and 'i+1' until all cards are flip down. But, condition for fliping is that we have to take two adjacent card. The Left one will face turn face down if not and the right one will face up if face down and face down if face up. And the loop will continue until all the cards faces down.
## Requirements
